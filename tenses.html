		<p>Tenses are relatively simple, however they span across multiple moods. Moods will be mentioned later on, but the moods do effect how some tenses work, for now we will use the simplest mood(called Indictative) which doesn't add any extra markers. In Turkish there are 4 main tenses: 
			<b name="Aorist is a tense similar to present tense simple in English(ex. 'I eat').">Aorist</b>,
			 <b name="Imperfective is a tense that works like present tense continous in English(ex. 'I am eating'), suggesting that the action is ongoing.">Imperfective</b>, 
			 <b name="Perfective is a tense that works like perfect past tense in English(ex. 'I ate'), it suggests that the action was completed.">Perfective</b>, and 
			 Future tense(Negative Aorist also exists, but can be considered just Aorist with special rules for negation). Keep in mind that tenses can mix with each other(imperfective + perfective = past tense continous(ex. I was eating)).</p>
        <ol>
			<li>
				<p>Aorist - -²r/-⁴r</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Imperfective - -⁴yor </p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Perfective - -t/d⁴</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Future - -(y)²c²k/ğ</p>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<p>As stated earlier, tenses are largely affected by moods, which are just another marker that change the meaning of how the action should be interpreted(instead of changing who is doing it or when it is being done). To learn about Turkish mood markers click the link below:</p>

		<h1>Moods</h1>
		<br><br><br><br><br>
		<h3>Moods in Turkish decide how the action is done or should be interpreted rather than deciding when it happens(tenses) or who is doing it(conjugation). In Turkish, there are 10 moods, 8 will be mentioned in this section because the other 2 have already been discussed in other pages.<br>If random capitalized symbols that do not appear in Turkish appear, reload the page.</h2>

		<h2>What are the moods</h2>
		<p>In Turkish there are 10 moods which are formed by adding specific markers for the most part. The Imperative and Interrogative moods will not be mentioned because they have been explained in the conjugation page. Here is a list of the moods excluding the ones explained earlier:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Indicative mood</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Passive mood</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Potential mood</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Optative mood</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Necessitative mood</p>

			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Reflexive mood</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Conditional mood</p>

		<!--Mini-Sections-->
		<h2 id="s1">Indicative Mood</h2>
		<p>This is the simplest mood, this mood expresses a fact and does not <i>need</i> a marker, this is the mood you'd normally use. However, you can use one to put more emphasis on you thinking that something is a fact.</p>
        <h4>Examples</h4>
		<p>T/D⁴r</p>
		<p>Almanya Avrupa'da bir ülke<u>dir</u> - Germany is a country in Europe(lit. Germany in Europe a country)<br>İçerim - I drink<br>Tavuklar hayvan<u>dır</u> - Chickens are animals(Lit. Chickens animal)</p>
		<h2 id="s2">Passive Mood</h2>
        <p>Passive mood translates similarly into English, it's like swapping the positions of the object and the subject(Ex. I see the cat(active) vs The cat was seen by me(passive)). Even though it translates similarly, Turkish does it differently by using a marker.<br>
		Now to actually say "by [x]" you need to take the word <i>taraf</i> and add the appropiate personal marker. Optionally, you can add the pronoun followed by the appropiate personal marker for said pronoun attached to it.</p>
		<p>Benim tarafımdan - By me<br>Senin tarafından - By you<br>Onun tarafından - By him/her/it</p>
		<h4>Examples</h4>
		<p>(N)⁴l - Passive mood marker</p>
		<p>[x] bir kedi görü - [x] see(s) a cat<br>([x]) bir kedi gör<u>ül</u> - A cat is seen (by [x])</p>
		<p>(Benim tarafımdan) bir tavuk ye<u>nil</u>di - A chicken was eaten (by me)<br>(Senin tarafından) bir tavuk ye<u>nil</u>di - A chicken was eaten (by you)</p>
		<h2 id="s3">Potential Mood</h2>
		<p>Potential mood is used to be polite alot of times, but can cause a "to be able to" meaning aswell. For example: "I can eat." If used with the question marker, then you create a question asking "Can/May/Could I [x]?"</p>
		<h4>Examples</h4>
		<p>(Y)²bil - Potential mood marker(ir for aorist is used here)</p>
		<p>Yi<u>yebil</u>irim - I can eat<br>Yiyebilir miyim? - Can I eat?</p>
		<p>Tavuk yi<u>yebil</u>irim - I might eat chicken<br>Tavuğu yi<u>yebil</u>ir miyim? - May I eat the chicken?</p>
		<h2 id="s4">Optative Mood</h2>
		<p>Optative moods expresses desires and wants, some call this the "subjunctive mood." Optative is mostly used for first-person, and causes a "Let's..." or "Let me..." meaning.</p>
		<h4>Examples</h4>
		<p>(Y)² - Optative mood marker<br>(Y)²l⁴m - First-person plural optative mood marker</p>
		<p>Oyna<u>yalım</u> - Let's play<br>Oyna<u>ya</u>yım - Let me play</p>
		<p>Combine this with Interrogative mood(the question marker) to create a "Shall..." meaning.</p>
		<p>Oyna<u>yalım</u> mı? - Shall we play?</p>
		<h2 id="s5">Necessitative Mood</h2>
		<p>If you want to say that you <i>need to</i> or <i>must</i> do something, use Necessitative mood. For other people, it comes off more as a "should."</p>
		<h4>Examples</h4>
		<p>M²l⁴ - Necessitative mood marker</p>
		<p>Git<u>meli</u>yim - I have to go/I must go<br>Git<u>meli</u>sin - You should go</p>
		<p>Hayır, ekmeği ye<u>meli</u>sin - No, you should eat the bread</p>
		<h2 id="s6">Causative Mood</h2>
		<p>Causative mood is used to say you made someone or something do something, for example "I made you look" would use causative mood. Causative mood actually has many markers with no real rule on which should be used in which case.</p>
		<h4>Examples</h4>
		<p>T/D⁴r / -(²)r / -(⁴)t - Causative mood markers</p>
		<p>Yemek - To eat<br>Yedirmek - To feed(lit. to make eat)</p>
		<p>Kediyi ye<u>dir</u>im - I feed the cat</p>
		<h2 id="s7">Inferential Mood</h2>
		<p>Inferential mood suggests that what you're saying is based on an inference or is a report on something you were not there to witness. You'd see this mood used on the Turkish news channels. This mood can translate to "apparently," "it is said that," or "must've."</p>
		<h4>Examples</h4>
		<p>M⁴ş - Inferential mood marker</p>
		<p>O cileği ye<u>miş</u> - He/She/It must've eaten the strawberry</p>
		<p>Kedileri ona ver<u>miş</u>sin - You apparently gave him/her/it cats / You must've given him/her/it cats.</p>
		<h2 id="s8">Conditional Mood</h2>
		<p>This mood works like an if clause in English.</p>
		<h4>Examples</h4>
		<p>S² - Conditional mood markers</p>
		<p>Yemeği yer<u>se</u>ydim, annem mutlu - If I ate the food, my mother is happy.</p>
		<p>Sütü içmez<u>se</u>n, kızarım - If you don't drink the milk, I'm angry.</p>

		<h1>Noun Cases</h1>
		<br><br><br><br><br>
		<h3>Noun Cases are a grammatical system where nouns change spelling(or in the case of Turkish, adds markers to them) to reflext a specific meaning or grammatical purpose. Keep in mind that while these cases can be defined a specific way, not every usage of them makes sense based on said definition.<br>If random capitalized symbols that do not appear in Turkish appear, reload the page.</h2>

		<p>In Turkish, all cases have a marker for them. These case markers tell you about the state of the noun. Turkish has 6 noun cases:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Accusative Definite</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Dative</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Locative</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Ablative</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Genitive</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Instrumental</p>
			</li>

		<h2 id="s1">Accusative Definite</h2>
		<p>Accusative is a little different from other languages, while it is used on the direct object of a sentence, it also requires the noun to be definite. A noun is definite if you would add "the" to it in English, or wouldn't add "bir" to it in Turkish, basically you are referring to one specific instance of the noun(s). Indefinite would be saying that you can't reference a specific instance of the noun</p>
		<h4>Examples</h4>
		<p>(Y)⁴ - Accusative case marker</p>
		<p>Ekmek yerim - I eat bread<br>Ekmeğ<u>i</u> yerim - I eat <u>the</u> bread</p>
		<p>Bir kedim var - I have a cat<br>Benim kedi<u>yi</u> var - I have the cat</p>
		<h2 id="s2">Dative</h2>
        <p>Dative is like the opposite of Accusative, it refers to the indirect object and translates to "to [x]."</p>
		<h4>Examples</h4>
		<p>(Y)² - Dative case marker</p>
		<p>Kedileri on<u>a</u> veririm - I give him/her/it the cats<br>Şimdi on<u>a</u> söyle - Tell him/her now<br><i>Dative is used here because in Turkish you're saying "[subj.] is saying/talking ([obj.]) <u>to</u> [indirect obj.]"</i></p>
		<h2 id="s3">Locative</h2>
		<p>This is self-explanatory, it says that someone or something is in or on the noun.</p>
		<h4>Examples</h4>
		<p>T/D² - Locative case marker</p>
		<p>Avrupa'<u>da</u>yım - I'm in Europe<br>Mağaza<u>da</u>yım - I'm in the store</p>
		<h2 id="s4">Ablative</h2>
		<p>Ablative case expresses movement away from something, so a "from ..." meaning can be formed from this case.</p>
		<h4>Examples</h4>
		<p>T/D²n - Ablative case marker</p>
		<p>Adam<u>dan</u> bir elma - An apple from the man<br>O Türkiye'<u>den</u> - He/She/It is from Türkiye(New name for Turkey, the main country that speaks Turkish).</p>
		<h2 id="s5">Genitive</h2>
		<p>Genitive is used for showing possession and the subject of a <b name="A relative clause is a subordinate clause that modifies a noun, and a subordinate clause is a clause that is dependent on the main clause and acts as an adjective, noun, or adverb in the sentence(Ex. 'I saw the woman, who is slow,' the relative clause is 'who is slow.').">relative clause</b>.
		The marker for genitive is replaced with personal markers when it isnt in third-person singular. Translates to "of [x]"</p>
		<h4>Examples</h4>
		<p>(N)⁴n - Genitive case marker</p>
		<p>Kedi<u>m</u> - My cat<br>İstanbul'<u>un</u> insanları iyidir - Istanbul's people are good.</p>
		<h2 id="s6">Instrumental</h2>
		<p>Instrumental suggests the noun is a key instrument in the action, this simply translates to "with [x]." Some say that this isn't really a case because it just uses "ile(with)" as a marker rather than a word, but for this website, it will be called a case.</p>
		<h4>Examples</h4>
		<p>(Y)l² - Instrumental case marker</p>
		<p>Çocuk<u>la</u> konuşuyorum - I am talking to the child<br><i>In Turkish, this verb suggests that you talk <u>with</u> people, not that you talk <u>to</u> people like söylemek</i><br>Kalem<u>le</u> yazmalısın - You should write with a pen</p>

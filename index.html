		<h1>Turkish</h1>
		<br><br><br><br><br>
		<h3>Turkish is an interesting language, with unqiue features that most other languages dont have. Turkish is a member of the Turkic Language family, and uses SOV(subject object verb) word order. It is also an agglutinative language, meaning it adds several suffixes to add more meaning or context to a word.<br>If random capitalized symbols that do not appear in Turkish appear, reload the page.</h2>

		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<p>In this section, the general grammar will be overviewed. To see more information about a topic, go to its page. The overview sections expect that you know everything already, and need a refresher, or that you have seen similar languages. There is a table of contents below to skip to a section if needed. It should be noted that "markers" refers to the suffixes, Turkish is an agglutinative language, meaning it will use these markers to form sentences.</p>

		<h2 id="pronunciation">Pronunciation</h2>
		<p>Turkish pronunciation is pretty easy because of the fact that most letters are pronounced similarly to English, and consistantly is pronounced as such(loan and foriegn words can be an exception).
		However there are still some challenges such as ü pronunciation and understanding the rules for sound changes. In Turkish, letter consistantly change their sound depending on where in the word it resides. There are <b name="Syllable-Initial is used to describe either the first syllable or describe something within the first syllable in a word">Syllable-Initial</b> only sounds and <b name="Syllable-Final is used to describe either the last syllable or describe something within the last syllable in a word">Syllable-Final</b> only sounds.

		</p>
		<h2 id="wordorder">Word Order</h2>
		<p>Turkish uses SOV or Subject Object Verb word order(Ex. "I water drink" is SOV word order, versus "I drink water" which is SVO). Verbs should always be last in the sentence, and subjects(especially if it is a pronoun) should always come first.<br>Below is how words are normally ordered(keep in mind there is a thing called inverted word order, which is used informally by some):</p>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<p>Subject</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Time</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Place</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b name="The object that is affected by an action, but wasn't directly affected. For example: Give him the book, the 'him' would be the indirect object because 'he' is affected but isnt the object being given.">Indirect Object</b></p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p><b name="The object that is affected by an action. For example: Give him the book, the 'the book' would be the direct object because it is the object being given.">Direct Object</b></p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Adverb</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Verb</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
		<p style="text-align: center;">(and adjectives come before nouns, like in English)</p>

		<h2 id="vowelharmony">Vowel Harmony</h2>
		<p>Vowel harmony is when the first vowel in a suffix(the main way Turkish makes meaning) is changed to work with the last vowel in the base word. There are two types of this, which are easy to do, but possibly hard to remember.
			 Even if it doesn't end in a vowel, the last present in the word matters(Information left out, check the page instead of the overview to find more information).<br>E-type means there will be two possible vowels: E and A.<br>I-type means there will be four possible vowels: İ, I, Ü, and U.<br>First we need to look at the vowel phonology of Turkish.</p>

		<p>In E-Type, the vowel matches the position(front or back) of the final vowel in the base word.<br>In I-type, the vowel both matches the position and roundness(whether your lips are rounded or not) of the final vowel in the base word.</p>

		<h2 id="conjugation">Conjugation</h2>
		<p>Turkish conjugation is actually very easy once you understand vowel harmony(even if you don't yet, it's still easier than alot of languages). The endings are always the same, no matter the tense, and tenses do not involve <b name="Stem changes are when the verb at its base form is changed(ex. 'eat' becoming 'ate' is a stem change)">stem changes</b>.</p>
		<p>For the table below, letters in parentheses are <b name="Buffer letters are additional letters which in Turkish's case, are for seperating vowels, consonants, suffixes, etc">buffer letters</b>. The superscript 2 and 4 reference the vowel harmony, showing what type the marker takes(2 means E-type, 4 means I-type).</p>

		<h2 id="markers">Markers(suffixes)</h2>
		<p>Markers refer to <b name="Suffixes are added endings to words">suffixes</b>, these are the main ways Turkish makes meaning, instead of isolating words. For example: you can add -(y)im to the end of nouns to denote that you possess it, and you can add the marker to a verb to denote that you are preforming that action.</p>
		<p>Personal markers<br>-(y)⁴m/-m - First person singular<br>-(s)⁴n/-n - Second person plural<br>-(s)i - Third person singular possessive<br>-(y)(im)⁴z/-k - First person plural<br>-(s)⁴n⁴z/-n⁴z - Second person plural<br>-l²r - Third person plural</p>
